We will omit, here, tired narrative of a typical prole's day in the life in this dark, oppressive, grimy dystopia-- the daily trials, the endless toil, the lack of privacy, food, enjoyment, comfort, companionship, love. We will skip over lengthy, detailed descriptions of the internal structure and endless maintenance of the kilometres-wide, hermetically sealed, utterly inescapable Talmansk Arcology, prison of humanity.
